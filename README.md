# odin-recipes
Greetings from The Odin Project!
I suppose I'll just treat this as my personal diary of sorts and reflect on the things I've learned in this project.

In this project, I learned how to make use of a bunch of HTML tags, such as "p, img, a, h1-h2, meta"...and so on. I also took this opportunity to try and get accustomed to the usual HTML boilerplate, where I type it all out myself without using any shortcuts.

As for the project itself, it's simply a homepage with 3 links, each leading to a different recipe page, for that is the theme of this project- Odin Recipes, yes.

If you'd like to have a look at said recipes, then go on ahead. :D
